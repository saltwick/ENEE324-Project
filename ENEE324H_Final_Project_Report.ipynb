        "\n",
        "For this project we used accumulated NBA player statistics from the year 2014 up until the previous season (2018-2019 season). We gathered the data from [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/). Our preliminary data included 11 stats, (FG%, 3PA,\t3P%,\t2P%,\tFT%,\tORB,\tTRB,\tAST,\tSTL, BLK,\tPTS), while our final data added **Height** to the original 11 statistics. Through exploratory data analysis we reduced to fewer statistics. This process is described in our approach section. The height data for each player was not included in the tables provided by basketball-reference, so we pulled each player's height from the basketball-reference information page for each player. Our raw data can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-6pwAv2Xz1BJTd7Pb0yBK6wmOlAbqYu_X7MPdkgKyEs/edit?usp=sharing).\n",
        "\n",
        "We used the data from 2014-2018 to train our model for each position and then tested our model on the most player's recent season (2018-2019). To make sure the data we used was statistically significant, we only used players that played 30 games or more, while averaging at least 10 minutes played per game.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to cluster our players into their positions, we used Bayes law to estimate the quantity P(Position | Player). Here we define a position as one of the 5 positions in basketball (PG, SG, SF, PF, C) and a player as a series of player statistics representing a player in the 2018-2019 season. For each player, we calculate this quantity 5 times, once for each position. Then with 5 values for each player, we take the maximum value and select the associated position as our player's position.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our application of Bayes law resulted in the calculation P(Player | Position) * P(Position). We chose to ignore the summation in the denominator as we are comparing these values against each other and selecting the maximum. Since we are comparing the values, we do not need them to sum to 1, so we do not need to calculate this denominator. The P(Player) value, or the prior, was simply calculated as (# players in position / # players). Our likelihood function (P(Player | Position)) was assumed to be a Gaussian distribution. This assumption is based on the fact that each statistic was found to be close to normally distributed across positions. According to Bayes Law, the product of our prior and our likelihood function gives us a value proportional to P(Position | Player). \n",
        "\n",
        "For our likelihood function, we used an N dimensional Gaussian distribution where the mean and covariance were found as the mean and covariance of our dataset, accumulated over all years that we used. The dimension of this function (N) changes based on the number of statistics used to develop the model. This process is discussed down below in regard to our two-stage process.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Initial One-Stage Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "Initially, we calculated the likelihood function of each player for each position and multiplied it by the probability of that position. This gave us a value for each position for each player proportional to the probability that each player belongs to each position. Each player is assigned to the position with the maximum value calculated above.\n",
        "\n",
        "After running our test data (without height) through this model, we found an accuracy of **41.01%**. Seeking to improve this accuracy, we thought of a different way to cluster our data.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Note:*\n",
        "We only ran this method without including height in our data. After realizing the two-stage method described below provided more accurate results, we did not specifically perform this approach again after adding height to our data.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Our final approach includes two stages. The first stage clusters players into \"bins\" that best fit their stats, while the second stage clusters each player into the position inside their respective bin that best fits their stats. \n",
        "\n",
        "The bins were determined through iterative testing, calculating the accuracy of all 51 partitions of the list of positions, [PG, SG, SF, PF, C], and finding the one that yielded the highest accuracy.\n",

        "\n",
        "For each partition, we wanted to find the stats that clustered players into each bin with the highest accuracy. To do this, we iterated through every possible combination of stats (FG%, 3PA,\t3P%,\t2P%,\tFT%,\tORB,\tTRB,\tAST,\tSTL, BLK,\tPTS, and Height) for sizes 1-12 and returned the combination with the highest percentage.\n",

        "Stage 2 generates *n* values (*j1, j2, ..., jn*), where *n* is the size of the current bin of the current partition.

        "\n",
        "For the One-Stage Model and Stage 1 and Stage 2 of the Two-Stage Model we found that using too many stats led to less accurate results.

        "Many further investigations into this topic are possible. The weakest point of the model is the assumption that the statistics for each distribution would be fairly normal. While this did appear to be true, plotting 3 statistics together with a Gaussian ellipsoid reveals that many players still fall outside of the models predicted range. Developing a different likelihood function through other statistic methods could definitely improve the accuracy of our model.\n",

        "Another extension of this would be extending our training data to include more NBA seasons. We only included 4 seasons of training data; however, including more (10+ seasons) could improve our accuracy. One reason this may not be the case is that the game of basketball has drastically changed over the years. As the game changes, the roles of each position changes with it, which would skew our results and over many years could result in an underfitted model. \n",

        "Alternatively, we could test our data on previous seasons to examine how well our position models hold up for years before they were trained on. "
